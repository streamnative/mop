# MQTT on Pulsar (MoP)

MQTT-on-Pulsar (aka MoP) is developed to support MQTT protocol natively on Apache Pulsar.

## Get started

### Download or build MoP protocol handler

1. Clone the MoP project from GitHub to your local.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/streamnative/mop.git
    cd mop
    ```

2. Build the project.

    ```bash
    mvn clean install -DskipTests
    ```

3. The NAR file can be found at this location.

    ```bash
    ./mqtt-impl/target/pulsar-protocol-handler-mqtt-${version}.nar
    ```

### Install MoP protocol handler

Configure the Pulsar broker to run the MoP protocol handler as a plugin by adding configurations to the Pulsar configuration file, such as `broker.conf` or `standalone.conf`.

1. Set the configuration of the MoP protocol handler.
    
    Add the following properties and set their values in the Pulsar configuration file, such as `conf/broker.conf` or `conf/standalone.conf`.

    | Property | Suggested value | Default value |
    |---|---|---
    `messagingProtocols` | mqtt | null
    `protocolHandlerDirectory`| Location of MoP NAR file | ./protocols
    
    **Example**

    ```
    messagingProtocols=mqtt
    protocolHandlerDirectory=./protocols
    ```
2. Set the MQTT server listeners.

    > #### Note
    > The hostname in listeners should be the same as Pulsar broker's `advertisedAddress`.

    **Example**

    ```
    mqttListeners=mqtt://127.0.0.1:1883
    advertisedAddress=127.0.0.1
    ```

### Load MoP protocol handler

After you install the MoP protocol handler to Pulsar broker, you can restart the Pulsar brokers to load the MoP protocol handler.

### How to use Proxy

To use the proxy, follow the following steps. For detailed steps, refer to [Deploy a cluster on bare metal](http://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/deploy-bare-metal/).

1. Prepare a ZooKeeper cluster.

2. Initialize the cluster metadata.

3. Prepare a BookKeeper cluster.

4. Copy the `pulsar-protocol-handler-mqtt-${version}.nar` to the `$PULSAR_HOME/protocols` directory.

5. Start the Pulsar broker.

   Here is an example of the Pulsar broker configuration.

    ```yaml
    messagingProtocols=mqtt
    protocolHandlerDirectory=./protocols
    brokerServicePort=6651
    mqttListeners=mqtt://127.0.0.1:1883
    advertisedAddress=127.0.0.1
    
    mqttProxyEnable=true
    mqttProxyPort=5682
    ```

### Verify MoP protocol handler

There are many MQTT client that can be used to verify the MoP protocol handler, such as [MQTTBox](http://workswithweb.com/mqttbox.html), [MQTT Toolbox](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-toolbox). You can choose a CLI tool or interface tool to verify the MoP protocol handler.

The following example shows how to verify the MoP protocol handler with FuseSource MqttClient.

1. Add the dependency.

    ```java
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.fusesource.mqtt-client</groupId>
        <artifactId>mqtt-client</artifactId>
        <version>1.16</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

2. Publish messages and consume messages.

    ```java
    MQTT mqtt = new MQTT();
    mqtt.setHost("127.0.0.1", 1883);
    BlockingConnection connection = mqtt.blockingConnection();
    connection.connect();
    Topic[] topics = { new Topic("persistent://public/default/my-topic", QoS.AT_LEAST_ONCE) };
    connection.subscribe(topics);

    // publish message
    connection.publish("persistent://public/default/my-topic", "Hello MOP!".getBytes(), QoS.AT_LEAST_ONCE, false);

    // receive message
    Message received = connection.receive();
    ```
