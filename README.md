# MQTT on Pulsar (MoP)
MQTT-on-Pulsar (aka MoP) was developed to support MQTT protocol natively on Apache Pulsar.

## Get started
### Download or build MoP protocol handler
1. clone this project from GitHub to your local.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/streamnative/mop.git
cd mop
```

2. build the project.
```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

3. the nar file can be found at this location.
```bash
./mqtt-impl/target/pulsar-protocol-handler-mqtt-${version}.nar
```

### Install MoP protocol handler
All what you need to do is to configure the Pulsar broker to run the Mop protocol handler as a plugin, that is,
add configurations in Pulsar's configuration file, such as `broker.conf` or `standalone.conf`.

1. Set the configuration of the MoP protocol handler.
    
    Add the following properties and set their values in Pulsar configuration file, such as `conf/broker.conf` or `conf/standalone.conf`.

    Property | Set it to the following value | Default value
    |---|---|---
    `messagingProtocols` | mqtt | null
    `protocolHandlerDirectory`| Location of MoP NAR file | ./protocols
    
    **Example**

    ```
    messagingProtocols=mqtt
    protocolHandlerDirectory=./protocols
    ```
2. Set MQTT server listeners.

    > #### Note
    > The hostname in listeners should be the same as Pulsar broker's `advertisedAddress`.

    **Example**

    ```
    mqttListeners=mqtt://127.0.0.1:1883
    advertisedAddress=127.0.0.1
    ```
   
### Restart Pulsar brokers to load MoP

After you have installed the MoP protocol handler to Pulsar broker, you can restart the Pulsar brokers to load MoP.

### How to use Proxy

To use proxy, complete the following steps. For detailed steps, refer to [Deploy a cluster on bare metal](http://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/deploy-bare-metal/).

1. Prepare a ZooKeeper cluster.

2. Initialize the cluster metadata.

3. Prepare a BookKeeper cluster.

4. Copy the `pulsar-protocol-handler-mqtt-${version}.nar` to the `$PULSAR_HOME/protocols` directory.

5. Start broker.

    broker config

    ```yaml
    messagingProtocols=mqtt
    protocolHandlerDirectory=./protocols
    brokerServicePort=6651
    mqttListeners=mqtt://127.0.0.1:1883
    advertisedAddress=127.0.0.1
    
    mqttProxyEnable=true
    mqttProxyPort=5682
    ```

### Verify MoP

There are many MQTT client can be used to verify MoP such as http://workswithweb.com/mqttbox.html, https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-toolbox. You can choose a cli tool or interface tool to verify the MoP.

#### Verify with fusesource mqtt-client

```java
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.fusesource.mqtt-client</groupId>
    <artifactId>mqtt-client</artifactId>
    <version>1.16</version>
</dependency>
```

Publish messages and consume messages:

```java
MQTT mqtt = new MQTT();
mqtt.setHost("127.0.0.1", 1883);
BlockingConnection connection = mqtt.blockingConnection();
connection.connect();
Topic[] topics = { new Topic("persistent://public/default/my-topic", QoS.AT_LEAST_ONCE) };
connection.subscribe(topics);

// publish message
connection.publish("persistent://public/default/my-topic", "Hello MOP!".getBytes(), QoS.AT_LEAST_ONCE, false);

// receive message
Message received = connection.receive();
```
