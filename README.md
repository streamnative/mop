# MQTT on Pulsar (MoP)
MQTT-on-Pulsar (aka MoP) was developed to support MQTT protocol natively on Apache Pulsar.

## Get started
### Download or build MoP protocol handler
1. clone this project from GitHub to your local.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/streamnative/mop.git
cd mop
```

2. build the project.
```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

3. the nar file can be found at this location.
```bash
./mqtt-impl/target/pulsar-protocol-handler-mqtt-${version}.nar
```

### Install MoP protocol handler
All what you need to do is to configure the Pulsar broker to run the Mop protocol handler as a plugin, that is,
add configurations in Pulsar's configuration file, such as `broker.conf` or `standalone.conf`.

1. Set the configuration of the MoP protocol handler.
    
    Add the following properties and set their values in Pulsar configuration file, such as `conf/broker.conf` or `conf/standalone.conf`.

    Property | Set it to the following value | Default value
    |---|---|---
    `messagingProtocols` | mqtt | null
    `protocolHandlerDirectory`| Location of MoP NAR file | ./protocols
    
    **Example**

    ```
    messagingProtocols=mqtt
    protocolHandlerDirectory=./protocols
    ```
2. Set MQTT server listeners.

    > #### Note
    > The hostname in listeners should be the same as Pulsar broker's `advertisedAddress`.

    **Example**

    ```
    mqttListeners=mqtt://127.0.0.1:1883
    advertisedAddress=127.0.0.1
    ```
   
### Restart Pulsar brokers to load MoP

After you have installed the MoP protocol handler to Pulsar broker, you can restart the Pulsar brokers to load MoP.

### Verify MoP

There are many MQTT client can be used to verify MoP such as http://workswithweb.com/mqttbox.html, https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-toolbox. You can choose a cli tool or interface tool to verify the MoP.
